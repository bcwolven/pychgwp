<p>I usually work with two (external) monitors at home, and three (laptop + 2 external) at work, generally with 4 virtual desktops ("Spaces" in OS X), and I wanted a way to change the backgrounds for all the monitors in a particular space based on a theme of my choosing. My solution? Create a "wallpapers" folder (I sync mine via Dropbox, but that's another story, and not necessary for this script to work), set a WALLPAPER environment variable that points to that folder (I do this in my .bash_profile), and then tag the images in that folder with one or more "theme" descriptors, each of which is prefixed with "wp_",e.g., wp_dragonfly, wp_solarsystem, wp_titan (the moon of Saturn), etc. When I want to update the theme on a particular desktop I just type "chgwp dragonfly" in Terminal.app (or the terminal of your choice) on that particular desktop, and each of the displays is updated to a unique image bearing that tag from my wallpapers folder. If I just type "chgwp" without a theme, something gets chosen randomly from that folder.</p>

<a id="warnings" class="anchor" href="#warnings" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Warnings</h3>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This script relies on the availablility of the
following modules that come with the "stock" OS X Python: 
</p><pre><code>
from AppKit import NSWorkspace, NSScreen
from Foundation import NSURL
</code></pre>


<p>Now *my* default version of Python is *not* the standard OS version,
but you can specify which version of Python is called in various ways.
To use this script I simply make it executable and include the
following as the first line:
</p><pre><code>
#!/usr/bin/python
</code></pre>


<p>You can point to a different version of Python, say that installed
using <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>, by changing that first
line to the following, e.g., if you've installed a particular package
using brew and don't <em>want</em> to use the standard OS version of
Python.
</p><pre><code>
#!/usr/local/bin/python
</code></pre>

<a id="caveats" class="anchor" href="#caveats" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Caveats</h3>

<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what this will do if you treat each display as a separate space - this is an option in the System Preferences, but not one I've ever chosen to use. 
</li>
<li>If you've got more displays than you have wallpapers for a given theme/tag, something unfortunate might happen. I don't think I've added a check for that case yet. It's on the to-do list.
</li>
<li>I've got a really long to-do list.
</li>
</ul>
