<p>I usually work with two (external) monitors at home, and three (laptop + 2 external) at work, generally with 4 virtual desktops ("Spaces" in OS X), and I wanted a way to change the backgrounds for all the monitors in a particular space based on a theme of my choosing. My solution? Create a "wallpapers" folder (I sync mine via Dropbox, but that's another story, and not necessary for this script to work), set a WALLPAPER environment variable that points to that folder (I do this in my .bash_profile), and then tag the images in that folder with one or more "theme" descriptors, each of which is prefixed with "wp_",e.g., wp_dragonfly, wp_solarsystem, wp_titan (the moon of Saturn), etc. When I want to update the theme on a particular desktop I just type "chgwp dragonfly" in Terminal.app (or the terminal of your choice) on that particular desktop, and each of the displays is updated to a unique image bearing that tag from my wallpapers folder. If I just type "chgwp" without a theme, something gets chosen randomly from that folder.</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm not sure what this will do if you treat each display as a separate space - this is an option in the System Preferences, but not one I've ever chosen to use. 
</li>
<li>If you've got more displays than you have wallpapers for a given theme/tag, something unfortunate might happen. I don't think I've added a check for that case yet. It's on the to-do list.
</li>
<li>I've got a really long to-do list.
