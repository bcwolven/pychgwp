{"name":"Pychgwp","tagline":"Python script to change OS X wallpaper independently on all connected monitors based on a supplied \"theme\" keyword.","body":"### I'm kind of a desktop wallpaper junkie\r\nI usually work with two (external) monitors at home, and three (laptop + 2 external) at work, generally with 4 virtual desktops (\"Spaces\" in OS X), and I wanted a way to change the backgrounds for all the monitors in a particular space based on a theme of my choosing. My solution? Create a \"wallpapers\" folder (I sync mine via Dropbox, but that's another story, and not necessary for this script to work), set a WALLPAPER environment variable that points to that folder (I do this in my .bash_profile), and then tag the images in that folder with one or more \"theme\" descriptors, each of which is prefixed with \"wp_\",e.g., wp_dragonfly, wp_solarsystem, wp_titan (the moon of Saturn), etc. When I want to update the theme on a particular desktop I just type \"chgwp dragonfly\" in Terminal.app (or the terminal of your choice) on that particular desktop, and each of the displays is updated to a unique image bearing that tag from my wallpapers folder. If I just type \"chgwp\" without a theme, something gets chosen randomly from that folder.\r\n\r\n###Warnings\r\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This script relies on the availablility of the\r\nfollowing modules that come with the \"stock\" OS X Python: \r\n<pre><code>from AppKit import NSWorkspace, NSScreen\r\nfrom Foundation import NSURL</pre></code>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Now *my* default version of Python is *not* the standard OS version,\r\nbut you can specify which version of Python is called in various ways.\r\nTo use this script I simply make it executable and include the\r\nfollowing as the first line:\r\n<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python</pre></code>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>You can point to a different version of Python, say that installed\r\nusing <a href=\"http://brew.sh\">Homebrew</a>, by changing that first\r\nline to the following, e.g., if you've installed a particular package\r\nusing brew and don't <em>want</em> to use the standard OS version of\r\nPython.\r\n<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/python</pre></code>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n###Caveats\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I'm not sure what this will do if you treat each display as a separate space - this is an option in the System Preferences, but not one I've ever chosen to use. \r\n<li>If you've got more displays than you have wallpapers for a given theme/tag, something unfortunate might happen. I don't think I've added a check for that case yet. It's on the to-do list.\r\n<li>I've got a really long to-do list.\r\n</ul>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
